**Customer Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Health & Personal Care Reviews**
**Toolset: Python, VADER, Pandas, Matplotlib, LDA Topic Modelling, Power BI**
**Dataset: Amazon Reviews (346,000+ entries)**

Conducted large-scale sentiment analysis and topic modelling on 346K+ Amazon Health & Personal Care reviews to extract actionable insights on consumer satisfaction, product performance, and review behaviour.
Key contributions include:

- Automated sentiment scoring using VADER to detect emotional polarity in review text, identifying a strong correlation (0.7+) between review tone and star ratings.

- Mapped customer behaviour: Verified that longer, detailed reviews were more helpful, while negative reviews were often more informative despite being fewer.

- Visualised consumer patterns across pricing, brand reputation, and perceived valueâ€”showing that satisfaction was driven more by performance than price.

- Used LDA topic modelling to uncover hidden themes like product usability, health outcomes, and value perception, revealing critical consumer priorities.

- Delivered a final interactive dashboard and analytics report that demonstrated how sentiment and content insights can directly support marketing, product improvement, and customer engagement strategies.
